This object can created by using 'Date()' constructor.
'new Date()' creates a date object with the current date and time.
syntax:   const d = new Date();
where, 'd' stores a constant value of current date & time from date object 
created by 'Date()' constructor.

*Object{ key:value,---,--,---}: 
A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method).
The syntax of 'creating object' using 'object literal' is given below:
object={property1:value1,property2:value2.....propertyN:valueN}  

*'Date()' object has various methods:
getDate() - To Get day as a number (1-31).
getMonth() - To Get month as a number (0-11).
getFullYear() - To Get year as a four digit number (yyyy).

*'months' array taking 12 values indexing from 0 to 12
representing no. of days per 12 months in a year.

Initially,We are i)getting today's date and ii)accepting a date inserted by user.

We are splitting user inserted date into separate sections as-
date, month & year respectively and storing these parts into an object.

Similarly, we are splitting today's date into sections as-
crrentDate, currentMonth & currentYear respectively.

Using combinations of both the splittings we are checking
for the valid input inserted by a user.
Also, we are checking whether currentYear is a Leap year or not
and proceed further with a result by leapChecker() function.
(Because in case of leap year, we have to count 29 days for February
'months[1] = 29;', where array index '1' of an array 'months' indicates February.)

By subtracting user's birth year from currentYear,
user's birth month from currentMonth & user's birth date from
currentDate, We can i)get user's today's age and ii)display it using
displayResult() function. After defining this displayResult() outside 
ageCalculate(), we call this displayResult() inside ageCalculate().

Finally, We implement functioning for 'reset' button:
i)Target a button and store it's value to a variable
ii)Add an event to that variable
iii)Using DOM attributes 'textContent' & 'value', we reset required fields.
